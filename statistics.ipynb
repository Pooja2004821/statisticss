        "- The expected value (also called the mean or mathematical expectation) of a random variable represents the average outcome you would expect over many trials of a random experiment.It gives a measure of the center of a probability distribution — essentially, it's a weighted average of all possible values.\n",

        "- A probability distribution describes how the values of a random variable are distributed — i.e., how likely each outcome is. The expected outcome (or expected value) is the long-run average result you’d get if the random experiment were repeated many times.\n",
        "- Relationship Explained Simply : A random variable takes on values, each with an associated probability (from the distribution).The expected value is a weighted average of all possible values — where the weights are their probabilities.\n",
